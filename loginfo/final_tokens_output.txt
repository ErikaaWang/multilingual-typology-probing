TokenList<I, had, to, go, to, the, BBC, for, this, report, .>
TokenList<It, 's, symptomatic, ,, I, suppose, ,, of, our, fast, -, paced, ,, 24, hour, news, -, cycle, lives, ,, that, the, biggest, short, -, term, humanitarian, crisis, in, the, world, would, quickly, be, eclipsed, ,, once, our, Secretary, of, State, was, finished, with, his, whirlwind, tour, ,, from, the, newspapers, .>
TokenList<It, 's, just, disappointing, .>
TokenList<Most, troubling, ,, however, ,, is, the, fact, that, the, political, will, to, end, the, crisis, expressed, a, few, short, weeks, ago, seems, to, have, ebbed, .>
TokenList<At, that, time, ,, UN, Secretary, General, Kofi, Annan, demanded, steps, be, taken, to, end, the, ethnic, violence, in, Darfur, within, 48, hours, .>
TokenList<Two, weeks, later, ,, and, the, violence, continues, .>
TokenList<The, African, Union, is, clearly, not, up, to, the, task, of, keeping, the, peace, ,, pledging, 300, troops, to, an, area, that, will, need, 15,000, ,, according, to, analysts, .>
TokenList<And, international, donors, have, given, only, half, of, the, relief, aid, that, Darfur, needs, ,, according, to, the, local, UN, officials, .>
TokenList<So, hear, we, are, ,, two, weeks, later, ,, after, that, dazzling, PR, display, two, weeks, ago, by, Powell, and, Annan, ,, and, the, situation, on, the, ground, in, Darfur, appears, basically, unchanged, .>
TokenList<Warren, Buffett, is, giving, away, 85, %, of, his, wealth, ,, mostly, to, the, Bill, and, Melinda, Gates, Foundation, .>
TokenList<It, 's, a, move, that, really, worries, me, ;, Buffett, 's, usual, justification, for, keeping, most, of, his, money, was, that, he, was, still, compounding, the, value, of, his, fortune, at, a, pretty, high, rate, ,, so, any, gifts, now, would, mean, significantly, less, money, for, the, foundation, later, .>
TokenList<It, 's, a, little, hard, to, parse, ,, but, at, this, point, his, ostensible, view, is, that, the, Gateses, are, very, good, money, -, redistributors, ,, and, he, wants, them, to, have, the, money, as, soon, as, possible, .>
TokenList<Which, essentially, sounds, like, he, 's, worried, that, Bill, or, Melinda, are, going, to, die, soon, .>
TokenList<I, assume, his, actual, reason, is, that, he, 's, worried, that, Berkshire, Hathaway, just, ca, n't, grow, quickly, enough, to, justify, his, usual, charity, policy, .>
TokenList<I, 'm, not, sure, how, the, market, will, react, .>
TokenList<It, does, n't, change, the, company, 's, intrinsic, worth, ,, and, as, the, article, notes, ,, the, company, might, be, added, to, a, major, index, once, the, shares, get, more, liquid, .>
TokenList<On, the, other, hand, ,, this, is, essentially, a, statement, that, the, company, is, overpriced, from, the, guy, who, knows, it, best, --, and, happens, to, be, the, best, investor, of, the, last, century, .>
TokenList<em, ..., no, ..., the, Gates, foundation, mainly, invests, in, medical, research, and, education, ,, that, means, donating, now, adds, a, tremendous, value, compared, to, donating, in, ten, years, .>
TokenList<Because, the, 10.000.000, people, dying, from, malaria, will, otherwise, be, dead, .>
TokenList<i.e, .>
TokenList<He, 's, not, giving, 85, %, away, ,, he, 's, giving, a, number, of, shares, each, year, that, decrease, in, number, at, the, rate, of, 5, %, a, year, (, until, gone, ?, ), .>
TokenList<He, mentions, his, wife, 's, death, having, an, effect, on, him, .>
TokenList<It, sounds, pretty, rational, that, he, 's, saying, that, Bill, and, Melinda, are, at, a, prime, spot, ,, so, starting, the, money, hose, now, is, a, good, idea, ,, but, Buffet, is, still, keeping, most, of, his, donation, inside, of, Berkshire, where, it, will, compound, .>

TokenList<This, acceptance, of, blatantly, terrorist, groups, as, legitimate, freedom, movements, is, a, cancerous, tumor, on, the, United, Nations, and, the, media, .>
TokenList<Over, three, years, after, 9-11, ,, the, United, Nations, ,, despite, their, attempts, to, project, strength, in, fighting, terrorism, ,, still, can, not, properly, define, the, word, ", terrorist, ", ,, waffling, over, the, issue, of, whether, the, murder, of, innocent, civilians, are, terrorist, acts, .>
TokenList<The, media, routinely, obscures, the, lines, between, terrorism, and, legitimate, resistance, ,, as, the, recent, article, by, Daniel, Okrent, of, The, New, York, Times, demonstrates, .>

TokenList<I, 've, been, fuming, over, this, fact, for, a, few, weeks, now, ,, ever, since, some, organizations, and, governments, suggested, we, need, to, accept, the, fact, that, Hezbollah, will, get, involved, in, running, Lebanon, .>
