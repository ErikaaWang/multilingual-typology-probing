Code and data for the NAACL 2022 paper "Same Neurons, Different Languages: Probing Morphosyntax in Multilingual Pre-trained Models".

We're tidying the code and are hoping to put it up as soon as possible.

If you want access to the code beforehand, feel free to [reach out](mailto:ks@di.ku.dk) and we'll be happy to provide it before then.
